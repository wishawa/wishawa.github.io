This is my website! It's new! It is powered by [Zola](https://www.getzola.org/) and based on the [DeepThought theme](https://github.com/RatanShreshtha/DeepThought).

LaTeX is cool
$$f'(x) = \lim_{h \rightarrow 0} \frac{f(x + h) - f(x)}{h}$$

Syntax highlighting works
```python
def test(numer: int):
	print(f"the number is {number}")
```
